### Ex 1.2

For this assignment I used the data structure dictionary to store my recipes. 
I did this because they allow me to store attributes of varying data types (here we used a string, integer and list) and it is mutable.
Whereas with a list or tuple I can only store one type of data and tuples are immutable. 
For the all_recipes however I used a list to store my recipes because they are all of the same type (dictionary) and Python allows that and lists are mutable.
